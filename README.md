# SQL Bootcamp Journey

Welcome! This repository is a record of my journey through the SQL Bootcamp led by the amazing [Priya Bhatia](https://techforallwithpriya.graphy.com/).

**Structure:**

- Each day's content is organized in a separate folder named `Day_N` (where N represents the day number).
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - `lecture_code.sql` : Code snippets covered in Priya's lectures.
  - `lecture_1_HandWrittenNotes.pdf` : My handwritten notes for better understanding and reference.
  - `lecture_summary.md` : Contains the lecture_code summary for quick revision.

**Purpose:**

This repository serves multiple purposes:

- **Solid Foundation:** The lecture code provides a strong foundation for each day's concepts.
- **Enhanced Learning:** My handwritten notes offer a personalized perspective and foundational knowledge.

- **Self-Assessment:** By maintaining this repository, I can track my progress, identify areas for improvement, and potentially help others on a similar learning path.

**Feel free to:**

- Use this repository as a companion to Priya's SQL bootcamp.
- Explore the code, notes, and additional information to solidify your understanding.
- Contribute your own insights and questions

**Together, let's conquer SQL!**
